x) Read and summarize. Hutchins et al 2011: Intelligence-Driven Computer Network Defense Informed by Analysis of Adversary Campaigns and Intrusion Kill Chains, chapters Abstract, 3.2 Intrusion Kill Chain and 3.3 Courses of Action
</h3>
<h4> Abstract <h/4>

- Traditional incident response methodologies assume an intrusion that is successful, while traditional network defense products like intrusion detection systems and anti-virus concentrate on the vulnerability component of risk.

 - These strategies are no longer adequate for some players due to the growth of the objectives and expertise of computer network attacks. The term "Advanced Persistent Threat" (APT) refers to a new category of threats that are well-resourced and skilled adversaries who run multi-year infiltration campaigns against extremely sensitive commercial, proprietary, or national security information.

<h4> 3 Intelligence-driven Computer Network Defense </h4>

- A risk management method that tackles the threat element of risk by analyzing opponents' capabilities, aims, ideology, and limits is known as intelligence-driven computer network defense. This must be an ongoing process that uses indicators to find new activities that may be supported by more indicators. It necessitates a fresh perspective on the incursions themselves, one that views them as gradual progressions rather than as isolated incidents. In order to analyze intrusions and guide a defensive course of action, this study introduces a new intrusion kill chain model.

- An intelligence-driven CND has the effect of strengthening the security posture. APT actors try infiltration after an incursion by nature, modifying their activities based on each attempt's success or failure. Any repeat by the attacker is a disadvantage that defenders must notice and exploit since in a kill chain model, only one mitigation breaks the chain and thwarts the adversary.
